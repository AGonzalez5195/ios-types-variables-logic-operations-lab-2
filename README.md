## Question 1

You are given three grades obtained by 3 students in a class stored in variables grade1, grade2, grade3 of typeDouble.
Create a variable called yourGrade of type Double and give it a value.
Print above average if your grade is greater than the class average or below average” otherwise.

```swift
var grade1 = 7.0
var grade2 = 9.0
var grade3 = 5.0
```

// code here

## Question 2

You are given a number. Print even if the number is even or odd otherwise.

```swift
let number = 2
```

// your code here

## Question 3

You are given two numbers a and b. Print "divisible" if a is divisible by b and "not divisible" otherwise.

```swift
var a = 12
var b = 3
```

// your code here

## Question 4

You are given three variables a, b and c. Check if at least two variables have the same value. If that is true printAt least two variables have the same value otherwise print All the values are different.

```swift
var a = 2
var b = 3
var c = 2
```

// your code here

## Question 5

You are working on a smart-fridge. The smart-fridge knows how old the eggs and bacon in it are. You know that eggs spoil after 3 weeks (21 days) and bacon after one week (7 days). Given baconAge and eggsAge(in days) determine if you can cook bacon and eggs or what ingredients you need to throw out. If you can cook bacon and eggs print you can cook bacon and eggs. If you need to throw out any ingredients for each one print a line with the text throw out (where is bacon or eggs) in any order.

```swift
var baconAge = 6 // the bacon is 6 days old
var eggsAge = 12 // eggs are 12 days old
```

// your code here

## Question 6

You are given a year, determine if it’s a leap year. A leap year is a year containing an extra day. It has 366 days instead of the normal 365 days. The extra day is added in February, which has 29 days instead of the normal 28 days. Leap years occur every 4 years. 2012 was a leap year and 2016 will also be a leap year.
The above rule is valid except that every 100 years special rules apply. Years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years if they are not also divisible by 400. For example 1900 was not a leap year, but 2000 was. Print Leap year! or Not a leap year! depending on the case.

```swift
let year = 2014
```

// your code here

## Question 7

If you use random() it will give you a random number in a specified range. Generate a random number and use it to simulate a coin toss. Print heads or tails.

```swift
let randomNum = Int.random(in: 0...100)
```

Hint: use an if/else block along with the % operator

// your code here

## Question 8

You are given four variables a, b, c and d. Print the value of the smallest one.

```swift
var a = 5
var b = 6
var c = 3
var d = 4
```

// your code here
